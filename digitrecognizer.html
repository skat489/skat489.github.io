                    <p>I'm a student at Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts.</p>
                    <p>
                      When I first saw this project I was completely lost but something inside of me was determined to get it done and to see how proud I would be to make something like this would be so worth it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      I knew I had to use neural networks but I didn’t even know what they were and how they worked. So before even writing a line of code I spent days learning about neural networks, MLP classifiers, standard scalers all by myself. I taught myself these tools through youtube and courses such as CS50 Harvard course. Through many trials I finally got it. I trained machine learning to guess the blurred number shown. At first it wasn’t accurate which drove me crazy but after focusing and looking back all i had to do was tweak the training data and the iterations. I was done.

                    <p>
                      Not yet. After a week of daily effort you would think I would be done. But a digit recognizer is an average code and I wanted to do something different and cooler. With my own creativity I wanted the user to draw a number instead of the machine giving it out. At this point it was only a thought, no idea, no knowledge, just a dream. After using AI to help me to understand what I have to do, I was even more motivated. I knew I was so close but so far. Remembering from my CS class I took at Phillips Academy last term I remembered about TkInter. With this in mind the next day I went to my old CS teacher and asked her to teach me about tkinter once more. Now I was getting somewhere, I had the idea and logic down. I went back to VS Code and youtube and learned about PIL. Finally I can call it a success. I was proud of my work and was more motivated than ever.

                      I have always been fascinated by the potential of artificial intelligence, from large language models to generative AI. My work is driven by curiosity and a desire to explore how neural networks can solve complex problems.

                      This digit recognizer project is a testament to my self-taught journey—from the initial struggles to the breakthrough moments when everything started to click. Every lesson learned along the way, every video watched, and every challenge overcome has made this project possible.
