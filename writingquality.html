                    <p>I'm a student at Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts.</p>
                    <p>
                      My latest project—a writing quality predictor—was a journey of discovery and persistence. I started out feeling completely overwhelmed by the challenge of transforming raw keystroke logs into meaningful features that could accurately predict essay scores. Through countless hours of self-teaching via YouTube tutorials and the comprehensive Harvard CS50 course, I learned how to extract key metrics such as total keystroke events, average action times, revision ratios, and more.

                    <p>
                      Determined to improve my approach, I replaced the traditional map classifier with a powerful Random Forest Generator. Additionally, I experimented with a unique root mean scaling method to better capture the nuances of my data—a departure from the usual standard scaler. This innovation proved pivotal in refining the model’s performance.

                    <p>
                      By merging keystroke logs with actual essay scores and rigorously analyzing feature importance, I uncovered fascinating insights into how typing behavior correlates with writing quality. Every setback was a learning opportunity, and each breakthrough reaffirmed my passion for data science and machine learning.

                    <h2>Code Overview:</h2>
                    <p>
                      The system starts by loading three key datasets: training logs (containing keystroke data from essays with known scores), training scores (the actual scores for those essays), and test logs (keystroke data from new essays that need scoring). 
                    <p>
                      For each essay, the system extracts various behavioral features that indicate how the writing process unfolded. These features include the total number of keystrokes, how long the student spent writing, their average time between actions, and different types of writing behaviors (like typing new text, deleting, pasting, or replacing content). 
                    <p>
                      It also tracks more sophisticated metrics like the ratio of revision activities (deletions, pastes, and replacements) to total actions, the number of long pauses (defined as breaks longer than 2 seconds), the final word count, and the typing speed in characters per second. Once these features are extracted, they're used to train a Random Forest machine learning model. 
                    </p>
                    This model learns patterns between these writing behaviors and essay scores from the training data. After training, the model can then predict scores for new essays based solely on how they were written, without ever needing to read the actual content. The system uses multiple decision trees (100 of them, with a maximum depth of 10) to make its predictions, combining their outputs to generate a final score prediction. This approach suggests that the way a student writes - their process, pacing, and revision patterns - might be just as indicative of essay quality as the content itself.
