                    <p>
                    I have wondered to what extent all my school essays are decent before I turn in every one. The idea of fully measuring writing quality has interested me for many years. What makes an essay good? Is it how it looks, or how many changes it has? Or is it how fast someone writes it?
                   <p>
                    Taking apart writing patterns, tracking input events, revision ratios, in addition to pause lengths, puts a new idea into the writing process. Consider observing how small things in someone's typing greatly present how good the writing truly is. It is interesting to think about how people type and their scores.

                    Improved technology lets us study all creativity and structure in many new ways. Maybe soon, each student will have tools to give quick feedback. The tools will let students fix their work before it is due. That would change everything.

                    <h2>Code Overview:</h2>
                    <p>
                      The system starts by loading three key datasets: training logs (containing keystroke data from essays with known scores), training scores (the actual scores for those essays), and test logs (keystroke data from new essays that need scoring). 
                    <p>
                      For each essay, the system extracts various behavioral features that indicate how the writing process unfolded. These features include the total number of keystrokes, how long the student spent writing, their average time between actions, and different types of writing behaviors (like typing new text, deleting, pasting, or replacing content). 
                    <p>
                      It also tracks more sophisticated metrics like the ratio of revision activities (deletions, pastes, and replacements) to total actions, the number of long pauses (defined as breaks longer than 2 seconds), the final word count, and the typing speed in characters per second. Once these features are extracted, they're used to train a Random Forest machine learning model. 
                    </p>
                    This model learns patterns between these writing behaviors and essay scores from the training data. After training, the model can then predict scores for new essays based solely on how they were written, without ever needing to read the actual content. The system uses multiple decision trees (100 of them, with a maximum depth of 10) to make its predictions, combining their outputs to generate a final score prediction. This approach suggests that the way a student writes - their process, pacing, and revision patterns - might be just as indicative of essay quality as the content itself.
